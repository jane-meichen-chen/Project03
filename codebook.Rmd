The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.txt'

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_y_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second. 

Notes: 
======
- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
- Each feature vector is a row on the text file.

- training and test data are combined by using rbind()
- subject (ID) and activity label are combined with the data by using cbind()
- only mean and standard deviation (s.d.) of each measurements are selected for the tidy data.
- activity was originally coded in number (1 to 6), they are converted into factor labels using the activity_labels.txt
- the variable names are changed to make it more descriptive (e.g. t - time; f - frequency; acc - accelerometer and etc.)
- data is then ordered by subject and activity with s.d. removed 

intermediate variables listed below: 
- ActivityTest: test group activity code
- ActivityTrain: training group activity code
- SubjectTest:test group subject number (ID)
- SubjectTrain: training group subject number (ID)
- DataTest: test group measurements
- DataTrain: training group measurements 
- VNames: variable names from features.txt
- Subjects: combined subject number (ID) of both training and test groups
- Activities: combined activity code for both groups
- Datas: bombined data for both groups 
- combinedData: result data of combined groups with activity code and subject ID
- m_sd: variable names with mean and s.d.
- select: desired column for data with only mean and s.d.
- activityLabels: factor of the labels
- tidyData: final tidied Data
